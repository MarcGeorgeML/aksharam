% Problem Statement Slide
\begin{frame}
    \frametitle{ Problem Statement }
       \tem\textbf{Problem}
       \item Traditional textbook-based learning methods for concepts, subjects, and languages have become increasingly unappealing to modern learners. With the average adult attention span now at just 8.25 seconds, there is a growing demand for faster, more engaging, and cost-effective approaches to language acquisition. In our state, Malayalam remains predominantly taught in conventional classroom settings, limiting accessibility and failing to align with evolving learning preferences.
       \item\textbf{Solution}
       \item To address this challenge, we propose an AI-powered application designed to teach Malayalam from the ground up. The app introduces users to basic characters, progressively building their proficiency in forming and using common Malayalam words. Additionally, it features an image-based text recognition system that scans Malayalam text and translates it into English, enhancing accessibility and learning efficiency.
\end{frame}

% Objective Slide
\begin{frame}{Objective}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The objective of this project is to develop an AI-powered Malayalam learning platform that enhances language acquisition through interactive experiences.
        \item The system integrates a LeNet-based handwritten character recognition model to assist users in learning how to write Malayalam characters with real-time feedback.
        \item It also provides pronunciation assistance, contextual learning, and conversation-based examples.
        \item The platform employs OCR and a translation model to extract and translate Malayalam text from images.
        \item Additionally, it features a text-to-speech module for accessibility.
